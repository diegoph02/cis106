## Summary of Presentation: Introduction to Linux
An operating system enables the use of the computer's hardware, and the kernel manages the low-level features of the computer. Moreover, Linux is an open source operating system that is free, so it is available almost for every electronic device. Linux was development in 1975 as a multitasking system, and then, Linus Torvalds developed it further more in 1991. Furthermore, there are different branches of Linux called distributions, which mostly branch out from Debian. One of the most famous Linux distributions is Ubuntu, which includes thousands of software. Finally, software has two types of licenses, such as  Open Source and Closed Source. The Open Source license  can be distributed for a fee or free while the closed source is not available for the user to modify it.
