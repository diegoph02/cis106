# What is Virtualization?
It is defined as the simulation of a virtual machine within a physical machine. An entire Operating System can be replicated by using virtualization. For instance, one can virtualize a computer with a Linux Operating System inside a physical computer with a Windows OS. One benefit of virtualization is that it can run multiple OS in a single machine. Moreover, virtualization is divided in two categories.
## Types of Virtualization
* Server-side virtualization: It is an expensive virtualization that uses physical server. Machines that want to do virtualization need to connect to this server via the network.
* Client-side virtualization: A software has to be installed in the physical machine to use this type of virtualization.
