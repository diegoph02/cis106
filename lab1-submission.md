## Question 5
I selected the distribution named ChimeraOS. It is based on Arch Linux, and it is an operating system that provides gaming experience. If one is a a gamer, the page says that this OS is recommend. However, it is recommend to gamers that do not have a Gaming PC because this OS automatically puts games at the minimum. This means that is not recommend to people that wants to play their games at 100%.
